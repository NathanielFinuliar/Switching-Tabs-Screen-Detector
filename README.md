# Switching-Tabs-Screen-Detector
Python Scripts that takes screenshots of user's tab or screen. It also has its feature of Keyboard Keystroke. Once pressed by the user, the screenshots will be directly sent to the creator  

I am interested in capturing or detecting keyboard keystrokes and taking screenshots using python.
Inspired by this link --->  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xasRrM-CBV0

Idea: I can apply this python script to create a program for monitoring an online exam, It will become a valuable tool for teachers because they can detect their 
students using the alt-tab as a keystroke. A screenshot will then be sent directly to the teacher's discord server through the discord webhook.
