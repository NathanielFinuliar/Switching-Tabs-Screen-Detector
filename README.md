# Switching-Tabs-Screen-Detector
Python Scripts that takes screenshots of user's tab or screen. It also has its feature of Keyboard Keystroke. Once pressed by the user, the screenshots will be directly sent to the creator  

I am interested in being able to capture or detect keyboard key strokes and take screenshots using python.
It is inspired from this link --->  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xasRrM-CBV0

Idea: I can apply this python script to create a program for monitoring an online exam, 
I think it will become a useful tool for teachers, because they can detect their students if they're using alt-tab as keystroke 
and since a screenshot will be sent through discord webhook, directly to the teacher's discord server.
